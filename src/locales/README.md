# Translation

If you're on this page there's a strong chance you're interested in helping with the translation work for APSA!
Contributions of all sizes are welcome, from fixing small mistakes to adding entire new supported languages.

To start out you first need to contact me.

The best way to do so is by messaging me in the following APSA topic in the official Pokemon Infinite Fusion discord server: https://discord.com/channels/302153478556352513/1253038047554048050

If you'd rather avoid this method you can contact me via email at `fiddlekins@gmail.com` instead.

Alternatively, if you're familiar with using GitHub you can avoid both of the above methods and instead submit a pull request with edits or additions, and we can discuss any further details there.

## Format

For this project the files that store all the translations can be found in [this folder](.) alongside this readme.
They are named `<locale code>.po` and can be opened in plaintext editors, such as Notepad on Windows devices.

This `.po` format is called "gettext" after the name of [the software](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) that invented it.
